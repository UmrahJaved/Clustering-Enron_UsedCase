<h1>ROADMAP :</h1>
<h2> Day 1 </h2><br><br>  

| Person      | ToDo | Blocking       | Done   |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ---------
| Jari & Umrah      | Data Extraction, Data Exploration   | Clearity of Concept      | Data Extraction, Data Exploration 
| Vincent & Yass |  Choose ML model, Feature Engineeing | Confusion about the concepts and final outcome | Choose ML model, Feature Engineeing

 
<h2> Day 2 </h2><br><br>
  
| Person      | ToDo | Blocking       | Done |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------|
| Jari      |  Tech Talk, Q&D Piloting | Sub-clustering | Q&D piloting done, TechTalk NOT|
| Yass |   Research to understand process for topic modeling |Understanding clustering| Reviwing Jari's script to understand his pilot 
| Umrah |   Research to understand topic modelling, Experiment code| Understanding few concepts of the Jari's code  | Researched important concepts and did exploratory analysis
| Vincent      |   Research to understand topic modelling  | Clearity of end result   | Researched concepts of topic modelling

  Common Goals for the day:
  - [X] Follow tutorials
  - [X] Get familiar with the concept (vectorization/nltk, stop-words...)
  - [X] Experiment on Code

 <h2> Day 3 </h2><br><br>
  
| Person      | ToDo | Blocking       | Done |
