                  pulp and paper companies, with claimed revenues of nearly $111 billion during 2000. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that its reported
                  financial condition was sustained substantially by an institutionalized,
                  systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as
                  the Enron scandal. Enron has since become a well-known example of
                  wilful corporate fraud and corruption. This report aims at answering
                  whether top level Enron employees had incriminating evidence in their
                  office emails or uncover any unusual patterns in the months leading
